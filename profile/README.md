The EMTech project is a multiple CubeSat mission to capture Earth observation imagery that supports cartography, agriculture, forestry mapping and land use monitoring.
It will validate in-orbit an optical communications link, a high-performance data processor and hardened microcontroller, and an analogue mixed signal library.
Led by Athens-based EMTech Space, the consortium includes four Greek companies – Integrated Systems Development, Heron Engineering, Leo Space Photonics and Geosystems Hellas – as well as the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the Hellenic Naval Academy, and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
